Hey, thanks for the opportunity and I hope you all enjoy the result. Let's get started!

The project was built using the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

The project is deployed on Vercel, but you can also run it locally. For that you need to clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```elm
git clone https://github.com/larafe1/frontend-test-klever.git && cd frontend-test-klever

npm install
